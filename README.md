# Data-Structures-And-Algorithm
This course comprehensively explores data abstractions, core data structures, and algorithms essential for efficient program development. Students will acquire theoretical knowledge and practical experience to ensure algorithm correctness and analyze computational complexities. Topics covered include implementing data structures, algorithm analysis using asymptotic notation, and studying algorithm correctness. By blending theory and practice, students will develop proficiency in designing abstract data types (ADTs) for various structures and making informed algorithmic choices. Further, it also provides a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms, enabling students to design efficient programs and address real-world programming challenges.
